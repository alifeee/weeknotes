# Weeknotes 7

thinking about repair cafe
: I often spend time thinking about the repair cafe, but not going. maybe I will become a repairer soon.

booted (unofficial) LineageOS image onto old phone
: Flashed some stuff onto my girlsfriend's phone. Should be good.

valentines
: It was Valentine's day. Despite the many bad things about the day (rampant capitalism and financial shaming mainly) I enjoy it. I have a lot of love in my life to celebrate.

put up a shelf with manual drill (only broke 2 bits)
: My house has several shelves now, soon it will have more. Are they functional or aesthetic?

fixed manual drill
: The manual drill has a crank on it. It's fun to use. The wooden handle at the bottom spun around so you couldn't turn the crank: now you can :)

want to make coat hook
: I want to make a coat hook because the coat storage we currently have in the hallway is bad. Maybe I'll become a coat hook maker soon.

stuck more stickers on laptop (very full now)
: There is room for tiny stickers, so if you have any of those send them my way. Otherwise, I will start covering over the old ones in the name of impermanence.

watched surge pricing in action on e-paper tags in Morrisons
: I asked for some of these once and they said no :(

dwellentines
: I went to dwellentines

    fridge fooled us again
: We were going to switch the fridge door around to open from thee more convenient side, but the screw was too strong to remove

more rubber bands for the rubber band ball
: My rubber band ball is quite big now. Thank you to postmen everywhere.

helped Alex Ogden make <https://cukabaddiclub.github.io/>
: There is a manual selction so you can list out the appropriate players onto the visual graphic.

gloomhaven !
: Played gloomhaven. 

wellbeing !
: Went to wellbeing.

played Minecraft session 1 - "500-0 town"
: Minecraft with proximity voice chat. I hope no-one starts a secret cult.

posted some hackspace events
: …

considering my disdain for combined things (e.g., airbed + inbuilt pump)
: Things that come together when they could come seperate is bad. it encourages wasteful consumerism. Perhaps it would be ok if everyone went to repair cafes.

failed to download OneDrive documents (again)
: In my bid to escape from Big Tech, I try to move away from such things, and I'm both irritated and glad when they don't work very well.

tested controllers on PC, they work well apart from PS5 over bluetooth (wired is fine) - annoying to try and fix

# Weeknotes 30

Here are a few facts:

- last week's weeknotes were my longest ever
- there are 16 minutes until midnight
- I'm lazy when given the option

Here are a few results:

- This week's format will be an old favourite: the listicle

What did I do this week? Let's whizz through it.

## HOUSING

I'm looking for housing! (are you too???) Next week I will have made a choice on it! exciting.

- I've visited two houses. One was mouldy, one was not. The latter looks like a good option :)
- I've texted two people on SpareRoom. Neither is compatible practically.
- I've been invited to find a house by two groups of people.
- I've responded to two housing cooperative emails (after a long delay from myself)

## THERMAL PRINTING

- I've been printing GitHub updates via webhooks: <https://github.com/alifeee/github-webhook-printing>
- I've been printing a live feed of trains going by the window: <https://github.com/alifeee/stomp/blob/add-send-example/examples/send.js>

## WANDERINGS

- I went out with a friend. We saw exhibitions on Health and Metal, went to an expensive bookshop, and finally the library to appease the bookish needs

## CREATINGS

- I created a neat graph visualiser of the types of jobs people have in different areas of the UK. Have a look: <http://server.alifeee.net/occupation-data/>. The source code: <https://github.com/alifeee/occupation-data>. Did you know that in Exeter, [two people](http://server.alifeee.net/occupation-data/list.cgi?r=Exeter) work producing tobacco products?
- I put 105 photos from 2023 into a photo album. I haven't yet written captions for them, but I desire to.
- I finished my rag rug experiment. It's very nice, very tactile. I may make a much larger one.
- I (half-) made a digital version of a mind mind map from Sheffield Transformed: <https://github.com/alifeee/sheffield-transformed-graph>
- I fixed my Mahjong necklace (and a few others) by putting it on a new string
- I made an Instagram post.

## SENDINGS

- I sent [lipu tenpo](https://liputenpo.org/)'s print+post of nanpa linja
- I took pictures of the river we walked in and sent it to the river walkers
- I sent an application to join [UTAW](https://utaw.tech/) and was accepted

## HACKSPACINGS

- I made a start on a "month update" for the hackspace for July
- I [suggested some edits](https://github.com/sheffieldhackspace/Public-Website/pull/71) to the hackspace website

## LISTENINGS

- I've been enjoying [Samuel Pepys](https://mastodon.social/@samuelpepys/)' posts on Mastodon from his diary
- I wanted to install [Button Stealer](https://github.com/anatolyzenkov/button-stealer), but it looks like [Firefox support is lacking](https://github.com/anatolyzenkov/button-stealer/issues/7)
- I listened to Alexei Sayle's [Strangers on a Train 26/7/2024](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0021h3x), where he met two people going to [EMFCamp](https://www.emfcamp.org/)
- I saw a sign for - and thus looked up and saw if there were anything interesting for - [Sheffield Film Festival](https://www.showroomworkstation.org.uk/sheffieldfilmfestival)
- I saw some beautiful new flowers

## ATTENDINGS

- I went to [Front End Sheffield](https://sheffield.digital/front-end-sheffield/), where I learnt how to use a screen reader.
- I went to a housewarming. The house was warmed.
- I played Catan, and spend not too small a fraction reading about people's opinions on the game's colonising and growth narratives

THAT'S ALL FOLKS

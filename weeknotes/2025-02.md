## Travel related

I've been travelling a lot this week. Last week, I was in Stockholm. This week, we're in Tallinn. But I got here over land (and a tiny bit of sea). The route we've taken looks a bit like this (S is Stockholm, HT is Haparanda/Tornio, H is Helsinki, T is Tallinn):

                     /
                     T    
```

### Ways I have travelled

- (train x2) We took a train from Stockholm to Luleå
- (bus) Our connecting train was delayed from Umeå to Luleå so we had to wait in Luleå for ages and take the last bus to Haparanda late at night
- (night train) see below
- (tram) getting trams around Helsinki
- (commuter train) getting commuter trains around Helsinki
- (metro) I did not take the metro in Helsinki :[
- (boat) the ferry from Helsinki to Tallinn (a bit harder to go round via land for this one)
- (on foot) crossed the border from Sweden to Finland on foot, that was pretty fun

### Places I have stayed

- a hostel in Stockholm with a sauna
- a hotel with shared kitchen and common area (hostel without the shared rooms) in Tornio where we were the only ones staying (creepy in a fun way)
- a sofa with not quite enough room for two people

### Things that have been both a way I have travelled and a place I have stayed

A night train !!!! My very first. It was very nice. I had a shower.

### Museums I have been to

Mostly the free ones. The city museums are always free, and interesting. Otherwise, I went to see a very large, very old boat in Stockholm. Payed for that one. Living in the UK is the wrong way round as I expect museums to be free and then they are not when I am in Europe. I'm sure it would be much more fun the other way round.

### Food I have eaten

- Liquorice! I love liquorice. Unfortunately, the UK as a whole doesn't seem to like it as much. There's lots of it up here.
- MAX burger
- food cooked in a hostel kitchen, when available
- hesburger
- bastard burger (I left them a sticker to offset their "random sticker" vibe - I don't know they'll be impressed)

### Things I have seen that are snowy

- lots of snow ! so fun
- snowy trees
- snowy floor
- snowy lakes
- walking in deep snow (is fun)
- snow without slush ! when it stays below 0° C the snow remains so much nicer

### Things I haven't seen that are snowy

Sheffield, apparently.

### Things I have seen that are Moomin-related

- moomin tea
- moomin towels
- moomin map
- the moomin shop

## non-travel related

Welcome to the section of "here are the things that I'd be doing normally anyway".

I've been:

### Learning about mortgages

Here's a copy-and-paste from a quick note I made:

```text
https://www.uswitch.com/mortgages/first-time-buyer-statistics/
https://www.hsbc.co.uk/mortgages/first-time-buyers/rates/
https://www.nationwide.co.uk/mortgages/mortgage-calculators/borrowing-calculator/
## generic mortgage info
- you usually need to save 5% of the mortgage
- a mortgage loan will give 4-5x of income, so for £20,000 a year, about £90k
> a repayment mortgage of £175,000.00 payable over 33 years and 4 months initially on a fixed rate for 2 years at 5.74% and then on our current variable rate of 6.99% (variable) for the remaining 31 years and 4 months would require 24 monthly payments of £983.44 and 375 monthly payments of £1,125.30 plus one final payment of £1,125.75.
> The total amount payable would be £447,010.80 made up of the loan amount plus interest of £271,715.81 and a solicitors fee of £295.
## stats

  27.1% £597 - £888 / week
  30% £889 - £1372 / week
  27.7% £1373 - 16805 / week

- in 2023 in Yorkshire and the Humber, the average mortgage was £171k
- in 2023 in Yorkshire and the Humber, the average deposit was around £30-35k
```

### looking at StreetComplete

It's a neat app: <https://streetcomplete.app/>

You can go and feel like a small contributor to OpenStreetMap

### I watched an EMF talk

The talk is 5 minutes long, and VERY good. You can watch it her- no- you MUST watch it here: <https://media.ccc.de/v/emf2024-548-lightning-talks-saturday>

### I found out about `subfinder`

It seems like a neat tool to explore all the subdomains of a domain. I think the only subdomains it shows are ones with HTTPS certificates.

### I registered alifeee.net and the email <alifeee@alifeee.net>

I'm not the biggest fan of the etymology of `alifeee.net`. The first bit, naturally, is amazing. The second, `co`, I don't like, as I'm not a company/corporation. The third, I don't like, but a bit less, because I [don't care for borders](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/media/refs/borders.png) and to specify in whose I normally reside.

I mainly did this because I finally wanted to use my own (privacy-aware) email. I registered a <https://mailbox.org/> account, tested it out for a bit, was happy with it, and now I can receive (the easy part) and send (the hard part) emails from any domain I own! I went with `alifeee@alifeee.net` as the default. It's a bit tautological, but I couldn't think of a better one (`me@alifeee.net`? `email@alifeee.net`? `questions.queries.and.quandries@alifeee.net`? [p.s., they should all work fine ! or anything beforehand ! try it out… maybe… send me an email? … 👉️👈️])

Soon (see: this year), I will move things from `alifeee.net` over to `alifeee.net`. Very slowly. And I'll leave redirects on `alifeee.net`.

### I started re-watching The Terror

It's a great TV show. I haven't yet put it on my [list of favourite things](https://alifeee.net/favourites/), but I will soon, along with Devs and Around the World in 80 Days (both BBC miniseries).

### I stopped Universal Credit

I was on a self-employment scheme, where they support you while you build up a self-employed business. I [have one of those](https://alfierenn.dev/), so I was enrolled on the scheme, but I no longer am needing of their funds.

### I used a 12-foot ladder

I wanted to read this article: <https://www.wired.com/story/gravy-location-data-app-leak-rtb/>. Wired told me I'd run out of free articles. I'd seen a while ago a website called some foot amount of ladder, so I searched "11 foot ladder" and found only B&Q results. However, "12 foot ladder" worked a charm, and got me to <https://12ft.io>, where I was able to unlock and read the article.

### I'm annoyed at Outlook

As I said above, I switched emails. I want *every* email to one of my old accounts to redirect to my new account. This, it seems, is simply *not* possible. This is because some emails go to spam. You *cannot* *at all* turn off spam for Outlook, you must simply live with it. I relate heavily with the poster of [this forum post about that fact](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/stop-putting-my-mail-in-junk/6e505626-2204-4e6a-a49d-ebb142c6f3f7) (which made it onto my ["list of favourite forum posts"](https://alifeee.net/favourites/#forum%20threads), currently 1 item long).

I want my spam.

### I wrote a note

It's about ActivityPub: <https://blog.alifeee.net/notes/finding-the-account-information-of-a-mastodon-account-manually-via-curl-requests/>

## The End

Thanks for ~~reading~~ skimming. I hope you had a nice time, and the font was not too distracting.

When I next write, I'll be in Paris. C'est bon.

Ton prix, ce serait son lit.

until next week

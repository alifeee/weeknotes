hi !

this week I have lived an alternate French life – in France. I have spent a lot of time trying to speak my broken french, nearly getting run over despite the green man, and being impressed at the banality of the bus-ramps.

Back to tradition, what did I do this week, by day?

## LUNDI

- travelled from Brussels -> Paris -> Grenoble
- arranged my stickers from FOSDEM
- got a message request from (and texted) someone I met at FOSDEM
- put some more Terry Pratchett books (Wyrd Sisters, Pyramids, Eric, Moving Pictures) onto my Krindle

## MARDI

- explored, found bookshops, cat cafés, creative shops, libraries (`<3`)
- got a lot of brochures from the tourist centre
- got my hair cut and bleached

## MERCREDI

- tried to walk up to a fort, failed (path was barrée)
- went to a museum and saw an exhibit about comic strips
- went to a talk by Mathieu Bablet
- board game café with friends, friends-of-friends, and someone I met from <https://ma.pona.la/>

## JEUDI

- published HS meeting minutes
- visited a local hackspace
- played Gloomhaven ;]

## VENDREDI

# Weeknotes 51

This is (ISO) week 51 of the year, but it's week 53 of weeknotes! Which means I wrote a whole year'sworth! I've been enjoying it, and I plan to continue it indiscriminately.

For this special weeknotes, I have a special treat: I shall not be telling you what I've been doing this week, but in a role-reversal twist, I will be telling *you* what *you've* done this week.

Each item from a different person who has read some of these weeknotes. What have you done this week?

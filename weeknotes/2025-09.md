# Weeknotes 09

this week started with (re)signing a housing contract, eating at wellbeing, playing Minecraft, and doing a Discord Bot Making Mini Hackathon.

this week ended just now with a hitchhike as we got out of the final of 5 cars that took us from Cardiff to here. Thanks all.

A good trip to Barry was had.

- went ice skating (again!) wheee !
- saw a bit of an ice hockey game
- bought some new scissors for the hackspace
- fixed a watch strap and made a nice cushion to display it on
- wrote a short intro for a talk I might do early next year
- thought about friction traction again
- got some crème caramel yoghurts that didn't have a pull tab (what the hell!)
- my rent went up
- restocked the laser materials for the hackspace
- unblocked our blocked kitchen sink drain
- developed part of an MQTT message web visualiser
- sent out a sheet of purchase requests for the hackspace
- bought some eurostar tickets (I'm going to FOSDEM!)

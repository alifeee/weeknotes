# Weeknotes 03

welcome to weeknotes 3.

I am reaching the end of my travels. This note will be short. My word count must remain a rollercaster.

This week, I:

- explored Tallinn
- stopped in Valga
- slept in Liepaja (beach)
- slept on a boat
- slept in Hamburg
- tried to go for a falafel wrap, ended up failing and going for a falafel wrap instead 
- playing a lot of Slice & Dice
- been putting stuff on <https://alifeee.co.uk/favourites/> and been enjoying it

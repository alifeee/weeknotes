# Weeknotes 41

Good evening. I've been listening to a 1h30m playlist on repeat all week. I must've hit at least 23 loops of it.

Anyway, here are some other things I've been doing this week:

- had breakfast by the river
- went to wellbeing (it was very spicy)
- repaired my watch
- sent my pen back to America for a lifetime warranty repair
- went to Big Sainsbury's, Big Tesco, then Big Sainsbury's again
- bought a radio for my kitchen
- went to a party
- had my family over to stay
- broke-and-then-fixed my bike mudguard
- created a Downpour-tour of Sheffield Hackspace
- didn't go to a protest
- went antique shopping
- submitted a lot of receipts
- read a lot of philosophy blogs
- did a larder shop
- laser cut some pawns
- got given – and gave away – a load of strawberries
- watched The Lobster — meh
- did some more development for Movary :]
- agreed who would move into our house next month
- picked up my bike key and fob which I lost
- got a pull request I created 3 years ago merged
- learnt to knit (not to perl \[yet\])
- got a delivery some Arduinos and a Wiznet shields — yet to test
- set up dynamic DNS to my home server
- been thinking about how to set up access logging for my home server
- walked down the river-path parks
- found a very old book of lectures

That's all for now.

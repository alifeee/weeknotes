# Weeknotes 22

It's a very short one this week. I've just got home from [EMF Camp](https://www.emfcamp.org/) which has been a wonderful adventure of making and meeting friends, and simply chatting to so many wonderful people.

The randomly generated format, from the random generating format wheel, this week, is: incredibly brief statements.

If you would like to know more about any statement, please do [text me](https://linktr.ee/alifeee), [email me](https://linktr.ee/alifeee), or mention me [on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@alifeee)!!

## What I did not at EMF Camp

Outside of EMF, I sent off the 31 lipu tenpo magazines on Tuesday to people across the world. A picture was uploaded of some arriving to Germany today. Very fun. I don't remember what else, and I shan't try to.

Here's to much restfulness.

Hack the planet.

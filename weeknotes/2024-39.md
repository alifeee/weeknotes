# Weeknotes 39

Welcome. Time-aligned this week. And bullet points. The best !

For fun, I have separated these out into days, but I will not be providing titles. You must guess the edges of each day, where one ends, and where one begins.

What did I do this week?

- I booted [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) on my laptop. I already had a boot iso on a USB stick so I thought I'd try it out. It seemed fine. Eventually I might boot it on my laptop, but I'd have to get a new M.2 SSD as my laptopt only has one slot.
- I* went to a meeting
- I posted a blog post! about my sellotape dispenser! Read it here: <https://blog.alifeee.co.uk/2024/09/sellotape-dispenser/>
- I* went to a club and took some candy cigarettes to hand out
- I* created a timelapse of Catan
- I fixed my website, as the layout was broken on mobile for about a week after I changed it.
- I made a recurring weather image on my server. I use it on [my website homepage](https://alifeee.co.uk/) and also on my Android homescreen using [web image widget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ibuffed.webimagewidget). It displays the weather near me! and looks very cute! The repo is here: <https://github.com/alifeee/weather_landscape/>. In a weeknotes-first, here is the current image:

- I* went to a funky bar
- I* packed 36 magazines into envelopes and sent them off around the world
